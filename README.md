# :european_castle: slay-zero
A server browser for slay.one

## Installation
No special installation should be required.  This app runs locally and doesn't have a server element.  Put it in your web host's root, and you should be good to go.

## Setup
In `assets/js/main.js`, there's a username and a password variable.  You'll need to replace those values with your login credentials to see the games list.
